# S14 foundation HTTP handoff

Logic-only foundation for #246/#247. UI authoring stays with Claude Opus 5.5 at high effort and `docs/design/S14-bot-first-experience.md`. Import `createS14Handler` from `src/s14/web.ts`; inject `S14Renderer(page:S14Page):string` or extend its authenticated page routing under `src/s14/`. `S14Page` includes `state:Home`, `work:Work[]`, `csrf` and locale. `src/s14/main.ts` owns the opt-in composition. Keep `src/web.ts`/legacy runtime intact. The no-style JSON/form page remains the default contract exerciser; the product UI is wired in `src/s14/main.ts`. No framework, CSP exception or inline script is needed.

If `serve` is running, stop it before setup; setup and serve take the same exclusive runtime lock. Run `bun src/main.ts setup --s14 --password-stdin` for local owner provisioning, then `bun src/main.ts serve --s14`. The default is a fresh `.local/s14/application.sqlite`, loopback `http://localhost:3001`; overrides are `JIT_S14_DATABASE`, `JIT_S14_ORIGIN` and exact non-secret route metadata `JIT_S14_ROUTES`. Configure a supported exact model route explicitly; credentials remain in Schway's protected owner store. There is no live readiness/sign-in/host-capacity claim from this environment setting. Without `--s14` the previous runtime remains unchanged. An incompatible selected store refuses with `s14_fresh_state_required` and a fresh separate-path next action before writing or workers.

HTTP commands share one endpoint. First sign in through `GET/POST /s14/login` with a URL-encoded password; session cookies are HttpOnly/SameSite=Strict (`jit_s14` on HTTP, `__Host-jit_s14` on HTTPS handler deployments). Read `GET /api/s14/home` for `{state,csrf}`. Send command JSON to `POST /api/s14/commands` with exact same Origin, cookie and `X-CSRF-Token: csrf`. The body is always `{kind,requestId,expectedRevision,payload}`; **never send an actor/ownerId**. Generate one opaque retry key per logical action and retain it across transport retries. Reusing it for changed input fails. On stale revision, refresh the relevant query before owner review of new data.

No-script: `POST /s14/commands` with URL-encoded `csrf` and `command=JSON.stringify(theSameCommand)`. It redirects 303 to `/s14/receipts/:requestId`. All commands below use the same form path, with exact revision fields carried inside command JSON. UI can translate its own normal fields into these typed payloads on the server rather than ask owners to write JSON. Duplicate form keys/extra body keys refuse. No state-changing GET exists; all authenticated data is private/no-store and HTML must escape untrusted content. Authority controls must come from typed cards, never rendered model/source markup.

| Command kind | Payload | Revision source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setup` | `{ownerName,language:'th'\|'en',routeId,capabilities:{tools:[],resources:[]}}` | `state.revision` before setup |
| `message.post` | `{conversationId,text}` | conversation.revision |
| `bot.proposal.accept` | `{proposalId,capabilities:{tools:string[],resources:string[]}}` | current proposal.revision |
| `bot.proposal.reject` | `{proposalId}` | current proposal.revision |
| `bot.proposal.revise` | `{proposalId,name,responsibility,routeId}` | current proposal.revision |
| `task.accept` | `{taskId}` | proposed Work.revision |
| `work.start` | `StartPayload` in [work contract](app.work-grants-v1.md) | conversation.revision plus task revision when starting a retained task |
| `approval.decide` | `{effectId,actionHash,decision:'approve'\|'deny'}` | effect.revision |
| `work.stop` | `{workId}` | Work.revision |

Example direct internal start (all IDs/revisions/budgets are owner selections, not production defaults):

```json
{
  "kind": "work.start", "requestId": "unique_owner_retry_key", "expectedRevision": 1,
  "payload": {
    "conversationId": "from_query", "task": null,
    "title": "Compare facts", "purpose": "Compare the supplied public facts", "completionRule": "Evidence for owner review",
    "bots": [{"id":"jit","revision":1}], "tools": [], "scopes": [],
    "limits": {"attempts":1,"steps":1,"calls":1,"outputBytes":8192,"wallMs":60000},
    "expiresAt": 1800000060000
  }
}
```

The example timestamp must be replaced with a future timestamp within wallMs. In this root only tool-free internal analysis is active. Resource/share policies, public research, computer tools, standing routines, production effects and native safe replay are later slices. A task proposal accepted alone never starts; the work-mode composer directly sends `work.start` without another confirmation. Plain `message.post` and @Bot addressing never grant execution.

| Query | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/s14/home` | `{state:Home,csrf}`: owner/language, configured routes, Bots, conversations, typed Bot proposals and chat replies |
| `GET /api/s14/conversations/:id` | conversation/messages/proposals/replies |
| `GET /api/s14/bot-proposals/:id` | current proposal and content/author revision history |
| `GET /api/s14/work` | `{items:Work[]}` including proposed/accepted obligations |
| `GET /api/s14/work/:id` | WorkView: work, immutable grant/exact command, revocation, reservations, `actualUsage:null`, attempts, effects, `results` |
| `GET /api/s14/effects/:id` | current exact effect card and action revision history |
| `GET /api/s14/receipts/:requestId` | original committed receipt; no execution/replay |

## Product Web routes

`src/s14/main.ts` wires `createS14Handler(app, origin, renderS14, createS14Product(app))`. Without the fourth argument the handler stays the no-style contract exerciser and every API above is unchanged. All surfaces are server-rendered, `private, no-store`, CSP-strict and work without script.

| Route | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /s14/login`, `POST /s14/login`, `POST /s14/logout` | Sign-in, session end. An unauthenticated page GET redirects to sign-in; an API GET stays 401 JSON. |
| `GET /` | Setup until an owner profile exists, then Home |
| `GET /chats/:id` | Conversation. `?work=:id&tab=progress\|grant` opens the work pane; `?start=:messageId` prefills the composer. |
| `GET /work`, `/work/:id?tab=`, `/team`, `/team/:id`, `/proposals/:id`, `/effects/:id`, `/more` | Work list, work, team, Bot, exact proposal, exact approval card, account |
| `GET /assets/*` | Public hashed static assets |

Fixed-content decisions (`task.accept`, `work.stop`, `approval.decide`, `bot.proposal.reject`) post the seam's `POST /s14/commands` with the exact envelope in a hidden field; `GET /s14/receipts/:id` then redirects to the surface instead of returning JSON. Owner-typed forms post flat fields to `POST /s14/forms/{setup,compose,task-start,proposal-accept,proposal-revise}`, which build the same typed command and call the same `S14Application.execute`. The translator decides nothing: unknown fields are refused, `work=on` is the only thing that selects `work.start`, and revisions come from the rendered form. Each capability, tool and Bot is its own field (`tool:<id>`, `resource:<id>`, `bot:<id>=<revision>`) so the handler's duplicate-key refusal stands. A retried `work.start` form reuses its committed `expiresAt`, so the same retry key stays the same command.

HTML responses use `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`. With `no-referrer` a browser sends `Origin: null` on the page's own form posts, which the exact Origin check refuses.

`serve --s14 --refusal-page` adds a read-only explanation page after the refusal. The refusal, its stderr JSON and exit status are unchanged, and no store, lock or worker opens. Plain `serve --s14` still exits.

Typed states to map onto the existing Opus design:

- Bot proposal: proposed/accepted/rejected; old content revisions are stale; author bot/owner and proposerBotId are service-derived; rejected route is null, capability extras have safe dropped codes.
- Chat: queued/running/succeeded/blocked, plus safe reason. Replies increment conversation revision, so refresh before another mutation.
- Work: proposed/accepted/queued/running/waiting/ready/blocked/stopping/stopped. Ready is owner review, not a complete-report assertion. Start receipt pins exact command/grant. Stop remains stopping while real calls are open.
- Approval: pending/approved/denied/expired/executing/succeeded/failed/unknown; changed is retained in revision history. Show exact action, destination/content/hash/revision/expiry/requester, `supported` and reason. Unknown never offers a retry through this seam.
- Usage: reservations are finite, actual usage is unknown; no invented zero, concurrency measurement, provider readiness, research coverage or delivered effect.

All core types have one-line TSDoc in `src/s14/types.ts`, `authority-types.ts`, `application.ts` and `web.ts`. Product rendering, Thai/English copy and form contracts are covered by `tests/s14-web-ui.test.ts`; real device and assistive-technology evidence remains open. Follow existing external hashed assets and tokens when wiring the Opus design; the unstyled baseline is not a styling precedent.

Review-fix contract refinement (schema **3**): `Work.result` retains a bounded latest-attempt ID; `WorkView.results` supplies separately stored result bodies and original ready/waiting state. JSON detail queries and existing Web result rendering retain full granted output through 1 MiB; command receipts never copy that body. Schema 1/2 are unreleased and refuse rather than auto-migrate. The visible work badges refresh with their result regions, retaining the existing design.
